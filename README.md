# Animal Classification Project

Overview
This project aims to classify various animals into different categories using machine learning techniques. The classification is based on features extracted from images of animals.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of a collection of images of various animals such as dogs, cats, birds, etc. Each image is labeled with the corresponding category of the animal it represents.

Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/animal-classification.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd animal-classification
Install the required dependencies:
bash
