# Animal Classification Project

## Overview
This project aims to classify various animals into different categories using machine learning techniques. The classification is based on features extracted from images of animals.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of a collection of images of various animals such as dogs, cats, birds, etc. Each image is labeled with the corresponding category of the animal it represents.

## Usage
1. **Download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.**
2. **Train the model:**
    ```
        Animal_Classification_proj.ipynb
    ```
## Model
The classification model used in this project is a convolutional neural network (CNN) integrated with Tensorflow Architecture, which is well-suited for image classification tasks.

## Results
After training the model on the dataset, the following results were obtained:
- **Accuracy:** 92%
- **Precision:** 95%
